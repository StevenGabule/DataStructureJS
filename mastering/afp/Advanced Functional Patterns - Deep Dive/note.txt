Summary
These advanced functional patterns provide powerful abstractions for complex programming scenarios:

Transducers - Composable algorithmic transformations with optimal performance
Lenses - Immutable nested data manipulation with composable optics
Algebraic Data Types - Type-safe pattern matching and domain modeling
Functional Reactive Programming - Declarative event handling and async data flows

Each pattern excels in specific scenarios:

Use Transducers for high-performance data processing pipelines
Use Lenses for complex state management and immutable updates
Use ADTs for domain modeling and exhaustive pattern matching
Use FRP for reactive UIs and event-driven architectures

These patterns can be combined to create sophisticated, maintainable applications that leverage the full power of functional programming in JavaScript.
