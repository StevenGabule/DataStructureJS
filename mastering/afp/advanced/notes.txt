// Introduction & Core Philosophy
// Functional Programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of 
// mathematical functions, avoiding state changes and mutable data. In JavaScript, FP techniques can 
// lead to more predictable, testable, and maintainable code.
