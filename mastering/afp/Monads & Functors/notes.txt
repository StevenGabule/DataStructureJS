Understanding Functors and Monads
Before diving into examples, 

let's clarify these concepts:
Functor: 
	A container that can be mapped over (has a map method)
Monad: 
	A functor that also has flatMap (or chain) and of methods, 
	allowing for composition of nested contexts.


Summary
Monads and Functors provide powerful abstractions for handling complex scenarios in functional programming:

Maybe - Null safety and optional values
Either - Error handling with context
IO - Pure handling of side effects
Reader - Dependency injection
State - Stateful computations
Writer - Logging and accumulation
Continuation - Advanced control flow
Task - Async operations
Result - Rust-like error handling
Free - Building DSLs

Each monad solves specific problems and they can be combined using:

Natural transformations
Monad transformers
Functor composition

The key is choosing the right abstraction for your specific use case and combining them effectively to build maintainable, composable, and type-safe applications.
